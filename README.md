# Fine-Tuning ResNet50 on Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset  

## **Project Description**  
This project demonstrates fine-tuning the **ResNet50** model, pre-trained on **ImageNet**, for pet classification using the **Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset**, which contains 37 categories of cats and dogs. Transfer learning is used to adapt the model for this specific task by modifying the final layers and optimizing it for high accuracy. The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.  

### **Features**  
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Download and preprocess the dataset  
   - Image augmentation and data normalization  

2. **Model Development**  
   - Utilize the pre-trained **ResNet50** model  
   - Customize and fine-tune the top layers  

3. **Training and Evaluation**  
   - Set up training parameters (e.g., learning rate, loss function)  
   - Monitor performance with metrics such as accuracy and loss  

4. **Prediction and Deployment**  
   - Test the model on new images  
   - Deploy the trained model
